--functions are first citizen in js
--in js functions are objects

tyes
--function declaration statement/named function/pure function
--function expressure

-- function programming
    -higer order function
    -call back function
    - Arrow function
    -nested function
    -IIFE (immediate invoking function expression)

function identifier declaration statement
    -it is a set of instuction/ block of code used to perform specific task
    
    syntax:
    (keyword)--> function [fun_name (parameters,........)] -->identifiers
    {
    set of instructions
    }
    fun-name(args,...)

    return keyword
    will stop execution of the function

    Hoisting
    calling the functon before fun declaration

    {main adv of function
    code reusability
    write once call multiple times}


    {create a fun to perform arithmetic operation for 2 nums 
    and input should be taken from end user}

    --hoisting is not possible in fun expresion--->lead to reference error
    --syntax
    let demo =function(){
        console.log("hello")
    }
conole.log(demo)
ddemo()
higher 
it is used to perform generic task
a fun programming can be created using fun declarationst statement and fun expression and arrow function

    higher order fun
    a fun which accepts another fun as an argument
    call back 
    a function which is passed as an argumnet to higher order fun is called call back fun
